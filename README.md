## Project Description
Cpp-IntelliDrive-DiplomArbeit is a project aimed at developing a Generative AI that learns how to drive. This project leverages C++ and CMake for building and managing the software components.

## Features
- **Generative AI**: Uses advanced AI techniques to learn and adapt driving behavior.
- **Car Customization**: Ability to customize car attributes such as speed, handling, and acceleration.
- **Multiple States**: Includes different states such as MenuState and CarChoosingState for a structured flow.
- **Graphical Interface**: Utilizes SFML for rendering graphics and handling user input.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: The core programming language used for development.
- **CMake**: Build system for managing the project's build process.
- **SFML**: Simple and Fast Multimedia Library used for graphics rendering and handling user input.
- **Git**: Version control system for tracking changes and collaborating on the project.
- **Box2D**: 2D Physics enging for correct calculation of the Car.
